* Roadmap
** Explore edge cases in parsing
Currently it is a dumb implementation, does not check for
specific errors, like data not conforming to RESP.
There are apart from that no checks on length.

** Explore "frame" tracking like [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis/][in this mini-redis implementation]]
** TODO Add command parsing
** TODO Implement ECHO using the parser in place
** TODO Implement PING using the parses in place
